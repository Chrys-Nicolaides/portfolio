            I am a multi-disciplinary designer with a background in
            Architecture. I graduated with my Masterâ€™s Degree in Architecture in
            2016 and have gained 6 years of experience working in the field.

          <p className="py-4 mb-4">
            Today, I am eager to transition into web development and focus not
            only web design but also building impactful and meaningful digital
            experiences for users. I have a passion for problem solving and
            turning complex problems into intuitive and straightforward
            solutions. While I have experience in design, I am a pragmatist and
            appreciate that UX/UI design and development are reliant on each
            other. I strive to grow in both areas in hopes of becoming a well
            rounded front end developer.
