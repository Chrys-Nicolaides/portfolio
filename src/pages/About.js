          <p className="cs-body sm:text-base lg:text-lg 2xl:text-xl text-sm w-full pb-4 pt-0">
            I'm a UX/UI designer with a background in Architecture. I graduated
            with my Masterâ€™s Degree in 2016 and have gained 6 years of
            experience working in the field.
          </p>
          <p className="cs-body sm:text-base lg:text-lg 2xl:text-xl text-sm w-full pb-4">
            Today, I am eager to transition into web development and focus on
            not only web design but also building impactful and meaningful
            experiences for users.
          </p>
          <p className="cs-body sm:text-base lg:text-lg 2xl:text-xl text-sm w-full pb-4">
            I believe there is significant overlap between architecture and UX
            design, as both are people-focused fields striving to create
            meaningful experiences for users - be it in physical or digital
            environments. I have a passion for problem-solving, a knack for
            focusing on the finer details, and I enjoy turning complex problems
            into intuitive solutions. While I have experience in design, I am a
            pragmatist and appreciate that UX/UI design and development are
            reliant on each other. I strive to grow in both areas with the goal
            of becoming more well rounded when working on anything on the web.
